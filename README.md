**MVP**

The minimum viable product for this game is the ability for the user to play a single round of Text Twist. This includes seeing a 6-letter scramble and being able to type words into an input field, with the game responding by either verifying that the typed word is correct or telling the user to try again. The round ends when the user is able to type all possible words from the scramble.
